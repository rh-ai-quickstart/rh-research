# Maintain AI-Q CI and Governance

Use this skill when a developer changes AI-Q's CI, pre-commit hooks, or
contributor governance — the GitHub Actions workflows, the pre-commit config,
CODEOWNERS, the CodeRabbit review config, the copy-pr-bot mirror, or the
product-level skill-eval harness. These surfaces gate every PR, so a change must
keep the gate working and must not weaken security or review rules.

## Start Here

- Identify the surface: a workflow (`.github/workflows/`), a pre-commit hook
  (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`), governance (`.github/CODEOWNERS`,
  `.coderabbit.yaml`, `.github/copy-pr-bot.yaml`), or the skill-eval harness
  (`.github/skill-eval/`).
- Read the authoritative files below and `CONTRIBUTING.md` "CI and Bot Workflow"
  before editing — the bot/mirror flow is easy to break.
- Make the smallest change; do not weaken secret detection, auth gating, or
  code-owner review without a prior design discussion (see `AGENTS.md`).
- Remember CI runs on the copy-pr-bot mirror after `/ok to test`, not on push.

## Authoritative References

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md): "CI and Bot Workflow" — copy-pr-bot
  mirroring to `pull-request/<N>`, `/ok to test`, `/nvskills-ci`, `/merge`.
- [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md): "Git and PR hygiene" and the validation
  commands CI mirrors.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: jobs `pre-commit`, `test` (pytest + coverage),
  `helm-lint`, `test-scripts`. The `pre-commit` job runs Ruff separately and
  skips the push-stage pytest and Helm hooks when it runs
  `pre-commit run --all-files` — those checks run as their own jobs instead.
- `.github/workflows/ui.yml`: jobs `install`, `lint`, `type-check`, `unit-test`,
  `build`.
- `.github/workflows/skills-eval.yml`: the Skills Eval gate (push +
  `workflow_dispatch`; `detect-changes` path gate → `generate-datasets` spec
  validation → `harbor-eval` on the self-hosted `aiq-eval` runner).
- `.github/workflows/request-nvskills-ci.yml`: comment-triggered NVSkills CI.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: the hook set. Note `pytest-root`, `pytest-mcp`, and
  `helm-lint` are `stages: [push]` (see the reference for what that means
  locally). Root and MCP pytest checks use their own uv projects; MCP is not a
  root dependency group.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.coderabbit.yaml`, `.github/copy-pr-bot.yaml`: review
  routing, path-scoped automated review, and the PR mirror.

Longer procedures live in this bundle:

- [references/workflows-and-hooks.md](references/workflows-and-hooks.md): the
  workflows, their jobs/triggers, the copy-pr-bot mirror flow, and the pre-commit
  hook inventory (incl. the push-stage hooks).
- [references/skill-eval-harness.md](references/skill-eval-harness.md): how the
  `.github/skill-eval/` regression gate finds specs, runs adapters, and verifies.

## Workflow

1. Locate the exact workflow, hook, or governance file and read it plus the
   relevant `CONTRIBUTING.md` section.
2. Make the smallest scoped change; keep job names, triggers, and the
   `detect-changes` path gate intact unless that is the change.
3. Lint the change: validate YAML and, for workflows, run `actionlint` if it is
   installed.
4. Reproduce the affected gate locally where possible — run the pre-commit hooks
   or the job's underlying command (see the references).
5. Note that the real CI run happens on the copy-pr-bot mirror after a maintainer
   comments `/ok to test`.
6. Summarize changed files and the local validation evidence.

## Validation

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files                     # default-stage hooks (NOT pytest/helm-lint)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push   # adds the push-stage pytest + helm-lint hooks
uv run pre-commit run --files <changed>               # faster, during iteration
actionlint .github/workflows/<file>.yml               # if actionlint is installed
```

Expected: hooks pass (or only auto-fix) and any edited workflow is valid YAML.
`pytest` and `helm-lint` are push-stage, so the default `--all-files` run skips
them — CI runs them as the dedicated `test` and `helm-lint` jobs. For skill-eval
changes, see the harness reference: full Harbor runs need the self-hosted runner,
so validate spec/adapter shape locally and rely on the mirrored CI run.

## Common Mistakes

- Adding a trigger `paths:` filter to `skills-eval.yml` instead of using the
  `detect-changes` job — the comment in that workflow explains why path-filtering
  the trigger is wrong here.
- Weakening `detect-secrets`, auth gating, or code-owner review to make CI pass.
- Expecting CI to run on push; it runs on the copy-pr-bot mirror after
  `/ok to test`.
- Assuming `pre-commit run --all-files` reproduces the whole gate — `pytest` and
  `helm-lint` are `stages: [push]`, so they do not run at the default stage. Use
  `--hook-stage push` (or run them directly), and remember CI runs them as
  separate jobs.
- Editing `.github/CODEOWNERS` without updating the paths it routes, so reviews
  go to the wrong owners.
