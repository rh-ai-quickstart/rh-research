"""Per-user MCP auth control plane for AIQ.

AIQ owns the product control plane (status surfacing, connect actions,
structured auth-required responses, submit-time preflight). The actual OAuth
mechanics and per-user token storage are NAT's. AIQ mints the provider
authorization URL and completes the callback using NAT's public OAuth/token
primitives, then writes the resulting token into the *same* NAT token storage
that the headless job-time ``per_user_mcp_client`` reads from. See
``aiq-nat-oauth-execution-gap`` design notes.
