"""Transport-agnostic preflight for per-user MCP auth.

This is the single source of truth for "may this job be enqueued given which
protected sources the caller selected?". It is reused by two enforcement points
so they cannot drift:

  * the REST ``/v1/jobs/async/submit`` route, which wraps a block in a 409
    JSON response (``_preflight_mcp_auth``); and
  * ``submit_agent_job`` itself, which raises :class:`McpAuthRequiredError` so
    that programmatic callers (e.g. the chat researcher's async deep-research
    submit) cannot bypass the route-level check.
