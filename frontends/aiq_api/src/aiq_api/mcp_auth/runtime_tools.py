"""Per-job runtime resolution of per-user MCP source tools (built in code).

AIQ agents inherit data-source tools at *build* time, but a per-user MCP source's
tools are per-user/dynamic — the MCP client connects and enumerates tools using
the *user's* token. Two consequences shaped this design:

  * The tools can't be inherited statically by agents (no user at build time).
  * A ``per_user_mcp_client`` declared in the *config* is built by NAT's per-user
    *interactive* (WebSocket) session builder, which fails for a user with no
    token — breaking interactive chat. So we do NOT declare it in config.

Instead the headless async-job worker builds the per-user MCP client **in code**,
per job, after it has set ``Context.user_id`` to the job owner: it reads the MCP
endpoint from the source's ``mcp_oauth2`` auth provider, connects with the owner's
stored token (no interactive flow), enumerates the tools, and wraps them for the
agent. The client stays open via the caller's ``AsyncExitStack`` for the run.
