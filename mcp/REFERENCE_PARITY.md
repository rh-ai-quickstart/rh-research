# MCP compatibility contract

This document freezes the public behavior of the AI-Q MCP component and records
its intentional design decisions. It is a self-contained behavioral
specification for compatibility reviews and future changes.

## Validated baseline

The public implementation validates MCP 1.28.1, NAT Core 1.8.0, and AI-Q 2.0.
The ordered contract over tool name, input schema, output schema, annotations,
title, metadata, icons, and execution fields has the frozen SHA-256
`81eba67fadd56e64b58a84b700b202841f8636c93c6cbf63752507c8bf5ca96a`
and is enforced by executable tests. Descriptions are intentionally excluded
from that hash and instead have semantic golden assertions covering polling,
state, todo, report, and anonymous-capability instructions.

## Preserved behavior

| Area | Public parity contract |
|---|---|
| Tool surface | Exactly `submit_query(query)`, `poll_query(job_id)`, and `get_final_report(job_id)`, in that order. Each argument is one required unconstrained string and each output is a generic object. |
| Meta submit | Synchronous classification, persisted UUIDv4 job, and exact `{job_id, depth: "meta", state: "complete", result}`; missing meta text falls back to `I'm here to help.` |
| Shallow submit | Initial estimate/first-poll values are 10/5 seconds. The server waits inline; terminal work returns complete/result or failed/error. A timeout leaves the task alive, returns first-poll 0, and returns `max(0, int(10 - inline_wait_seconds))` as the estimate (the default 30-second wait therefore returns zero). An inline-wait infrastructure failure returns the original queued capability and cadence unchanged. |
| Deep submit | Always queued and never inline-waited, with estimate/first-poll values 180/180 seconds. |
| Poll | Status only. Found rows always include `todos`. Shallow queued/running cadence is 3 seconds; deep cadence is fixed at 180 seconds. Complete never includes `result`; failed includes `error`; terminal responses omit cadence. |
| Final report | Queued/running becomes `not_ready/job_not_ready` without todos or cadence. Complete includes result; failed includes error; missing/hidden jobs return the exact not-found shape. |
| Background work | The job UUID is also the NAT conversation/checkpoint thread ID. Submit creates a process-owned task; request completion and inline timeout do not cancel it. |
| Persistence | The Postgres schema, migrations, UUIDv4 IDs, 86,400-second job TTL, 30-second heartbeats, 300-second reconciliation interval, 600-second stale threshold, poll count, and cross-manager visibility are retained. |
| Todos | Only top-level deep-research checkpoints are read. Queued, shallow, and unavailable progress returns `[]`; running/complete/failed deep jobs may return normalized `{content,status,id?}` items. Reads fail soft. |
| Errors | Generic workflow exceptions, cancellation, swallowed no-source failures, stale jobs, not-ready, and not-found responses retain stable client-safe messages. Submission failures before a capability is returned, plus poll and report infrastructure exceptions, become sanitized MCP tool errors; internal exception text never crosses the transport boundary. |

The persisted state graph is:

```text
meta classification ───────────────────────────────> complete
research classification -> queued -> running -> complete | failed
lookup-only synthetic states: not_ready | not_found
```

## Public design decisions

| Decision | Public behavior and rationale |
|---|---|
| Authentication and principal | The standalone server has no authentication provider or actor-token propagation. Every call uses the constant `anonymous` principal; the UUID is the bearer capability. Authorization-like headers are ignored. |
| Malformed or noncanonical capability IDs | The public server requires exact lowercase canonical UUID spelling and returns the same stable `not_found/job_not_found` shape used for unknown UUIDs. |
| Transport path and health | The public endpoint defaults to configurable `/mcp`, with explicit `/live` and `/health`. The optional standalone SSE GET is rejected with 405. Host/Origin checks are DNS-rebinding/browser safeguards, not identity. |
| Lifecycle ownership | MCP 1.28.1 is mounted beneath one outer Starlette lifespan that owns the NAT workflow, job manager, and MCP session manager once per worker. Stateless request teardown cannot stop process-owned work. |
| Startup and environment | Startup validates the public workflow file and `AIQ_CHECKPOINT_DB`; public model/search credentials are `NVIDIA_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY`, while transport settings use the `AIQ_MCP_*` namespace. |
| Public workflow surface | The default workflow uses public NIM and Tavily configuration. Enterprise integrations and paper search are not part of this standalone profile. |
| Certificates | No CA bundle or certificate-mount behavior is bundled. Ordinary platform trust and deployment-level TLS termination are outside this component. |
| Logging | Capability UUIDs and exception text that might echo them are replaced by opaque references in normal logs. Client-visible sanitized error shapes remain compatible. |

Changes to the tool schema, state machine, response fields, polling cadence,
todo normalization, or persistence contract require an explicit update to
this document and its golden tests.

## Compatibility adaptations

- The destination validates `mcp==1.28.1`, `nvidia-nat==1.8.0`, and
  `nvidia-nat-core==1.8.0`.
- MCP protocol `2025-11-25` is exercised with the supported
  `streamable_http_client` and `ClientSession`, including stateless
  initialization and structured tool results.
- NAT 1.8 compatibility covers `load_workflow(config_file)`,
  `SessionManager.shared_builder`, `get_function("intent_classifier")`,
  `session(conversation_id=...)`, `session.run(query)`,
  `runner.result(to_type=ChatResearcherResponse)`, explicit `success`/`failed`
  workflow outcomes, and `Context.scope`.
- The public NAT workflow is loaded in a PostgreSQL-backed compatibility test
  without invoking external model or search calls.
