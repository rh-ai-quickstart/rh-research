# Knowledge Layer

A pluggable abstraction for document ingestion and retrieval. Swap backends without changing application code.

## Key Features

- **Rich Output Schema** - `Chunk` model with 15+ fields: content types, citations, images, structured data
- **Full Ingestion Pipeline** - `BaseIngestor` with async job tracking and status polling
- **Collection Management** - create/delete/list collections per session or use case
- **File Management** - upload/delete/list files with status tracking (UPLOADING → INGESTING → SUCCESS/FAILED)
- **Content Typing** - TEXT, TABLE, CHART, IMAGE enums for frontend rendering
- **Backend Agnostic** - Swap between local (LlamaIndex), OpenSearch, Azure AI Search, and hosted RAG Blueprint without core agent code changes

## Available Backends

| Backend | Config Name | Mode | Vector Store | Best For |
|---------|-------------|------|--------------|----------|
| `llamaindex` | `"llamaindex"` | Local Library | ChromaDB | Dev, prototyping, macOS/Linux |
| `opensearch` | `"opensearch"` | Direct Client | OpenSearch k-NN | Self-hosted OpenSearch, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless |
| `foundational_rag` | `"foundational_rag"` | Hosted Service | Remote Milvus | Production, multi-user |
| `azure_ai_search` | `"azure_ai_search"` | Managed Service | Azure AI Search | Managed hybrid retrieval |

**Local Library Mode** - Everything runs in your Python process. No external services needed.
- **`llamaindex`** - LlamaIndex + ChromaDB. Lightweight, great for development. Works on macOS and Linux.

**Hosted Service Mode** - Connects to deployed services via HTTP. Requires infrastructure but scales better.
- **`foundational_rag`** - Connects to [NVIDIA RAG Blueprint](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag) via HTTP.
  - [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag/blob/main/docs/deploy-docker-self-hosted.md)
- **`azure_ai_search`** - Uses one AI-Q-owned shared index in a managed Azure AI Search service. Collection and file
  manifests isolate logical collections. Canonical UUID file IDs support status and deletion, while same-name uploads
  coexist independently. See [`src/azure_ai_search/README.md`](src/azure_ai_search/README.md).

**OpenSearch Mode** - Stores AIQ collections directly in OpenSearch vector indexes.
- **`opensearch`** - Uses one OpenSearch index per AIQ collection/session. Supports unauthenticated local clusters,
  basic auth, and SigV4 for Amazon OpenSearch Service or Amazon OpenSearch Serverless.

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Complete the [main setup](../../README.md#getting-started) first (clone repo, run `./scripts/setup.sh`, obtain API keys).

> **Tip:** Instead of exporting env vars each time, add them to `deploy/.env` and use `dotenv -f deploy/.env run <command>` to run any command with those vars loaded automatically.

```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables (add to deploy/.env to avoid exporting each time)
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-your-key-here

# 2. Install backend (choose one)
uv pip install -e "sources/knowledge_layer[llamaindex]"        # Recommended for local dev - works on macOS/Linux
uv pip install -e "sources/knowledge_layer[foundational_rag]"  # Requires deployed server
uv pip install -e "sources/knowledge_layer[opensearch]"        # Requires OpenSearch/OpenSearch Serverless
uv pip install -e "sources/knowledge_layer[azure_ai_search]"   # Requires an Azure AI Search service
```

> **New to Knowledge Layer?** Start with `llamaindex` - it requires no external services and works on macOS and Linux.

```bash
# 3. Verify
python -c "from aiq_agent.knowledge import get_retriever; print('OK')"
```

---

## Usage

### With NeMo Agent Toolkit (YAML Config) - Recommended

The `knowledge_retrieval` function is registered as a NAT function type. **YAML config is the recommended single source of truth** for workflow configuration:

```yaml
# Example knowledge_retrieval function configuration
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval      # NAT function type
    backend: llamaindex             # Required: which adapter to use
    collection_name: my_docs        # Retrieval fallback when no session context is present
    top_k: 5                        # Results to return

    # Backend-specific options (each backend uses different fields):
    chroma_dir: /tmp/chroma_data              # llamaindex only
    rag_url: http://localhost:8081/v1         # foundational_rag only
    ingest_url: http://localhost:8082/v1      # foundational_rag only
    timeout: 120                              # foundational_rag only
    opensearch_url: http://localhost:9200     # opensearch only
    opensearch_auth_type: none                # opensearch only: none, basic, sigv4
```

You can also use environment variable substitution in YAML for deployment-specific values:

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: foundational_rag
    rag_url: ${RAG_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8081/v1}
    collection_name: ${COLLECTION_NAME:-default}
```

> **Note:** Each backend has different config options. Only the options matching your `backend` value are used - others are ignored (a warning will be logged). To add new config fields, edit `KnowledgeRetrievalConfig` in `sources/knowledge_layer/src/register.py`.

### Switching Backends

To switch backends, change the `backend` field and its corresponding options. Here are complete examples for each backend:

**LlamaIndex (ChromaDB) - macOS/Linux**
```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: llamaindex
    collection_name: my_docs
    top_k: 5
    chroma_dir: /tmp/chroma_data    # ChromaDB persistence directory
```

#### Multimodal Extraction (LlamaIndex Only)

By default, LlamaIndex ingests text only and uses the NVIDIA hosted embedding and VLM models. All options below can be overridden via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Embedding** | | |
| `AIQ_EMBED_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b` | NVIDIA embedding model |
| `AIQ_EMBED_BASE_URL` | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` | Embedding API base URL — override for local NIM |
| **Extraction Flags** | | |
| `AIQ_EXTRACT_TABLES` | `false` | Extract tables from PDFs as markdown using pdfplumber |
| `AIQ_EXTRACT_IMAGES` | `false` | Extract embedded images from PDFs and caption them with a VLM |
| `AIQ_EXTRACT_CHARTS` | `false` | Classify images as charts and extract structured data (chart type, axis labels, data points) |
| **Vision Model** | | |
| `AIQ_VLM_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` | VLM for image captioning |
| `AIQ_VLM_BASE_URL` | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` | VLM API base URL — override for local NIM |

You can also set these in `deploy/.env`:

```bash
# In deploy/.env or export directly
AIQ_EXTRACT_TABLES=true    # Extract tables from PDFs using pdfplumber
AIQ_EXTRACT_IMAGES=true    # Extract images from PDFs using pypdfium2 + VLM captioning
AIQ_EXTRACT_CHARTS=true    # Classify extracted images as charts and extract structured data
```

When enabled, the startup log shows the active mode:

```
LlamaIndexIngestor initialized: persist_dir=/app/data/chroma_data, mode=text + tables + images
```

When disabled (default):

```
LlamaIndexIngestor initialized: persist_dir=/app/data/chroma_data, mode=text-only
```

> **Note:** `AIQ_EXTRACT_IMAGES` and `AIQ_EXTRACT_CHARTS` work together. If both are enabled, each image is classified by the VLM as either a chart or a regular image. If only `AIQ_EXTRACT_IMAGES` is set, all images are captioned as regular images. Foundational RAG handles multimodal extraction server-side, so these flags only apply to the LlamaIndex backend.

**Foundational RAG (Hosted Server)**
```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: foundational_rag
    collection_name: my_docs
    top_k: 5
    rag_url: http://your-server:8081/v1      # Rag server
    ingest_url: http://your-server:8082/v1   # Ingestion server
    timeout: 120
```

> **Separate Docker stacks:** When AI-Q and RAG run as separate Docker Compose stacks, connect the AI-Q backend to the RAG network: `docker network connect nvidia-rag aiq-agent`. See the [Docker Compose README](../../deploy/compose/README.md#networking-when-aiq-and-rag-run-as-separate-compose-stacks) for details.

**Azure AI Search (Managed Service)**

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: azure_ai_search
    collection_name: ${COLLECTION_NAME:-aiq_default}
    top_k: 5
```

Set `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` and `NVIDIA_API_KEY`. Set `AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY` to use key authentication; otherwise,
Azure `DefaultAzureCredential` is used. Azure stores all logical collections, including UI session collections, in
one AI-Q-owned physical index and applies `collection_id` filters to isolate ingestion and retrieval. See the
[Azure AI Search example](../../docs/source/examples/azure-ai-search.md) for authentication, index, and embedding
configuration.

**OpenSearch (Self-hosted)**

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: opensearch
    collection_name: my_docs
    top_k: 5
    opensearch_url: http://localhost:9200
    opensearch_auth_type: none
    opensearch_index_prefix: aiq
    opensearch_embedding_dim: 2048
    embed_model: nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b
    embed_base_url: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
```

For self-hosted clusters with basic auth:

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: opensearch
    collection_name: my_docs
    opensearch_url: https://opensearch.example.com:9200
    opensearch_auth_type: basic
    opensearch_username: ${OPENSEARCH_USERNAME}
    opensearch_password: ${OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD}
    opensearch_verify_certs: true
```

For Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, use SigV4 with service `aoss`. For Amazon OpenSearch Service domains, use
service `es`.

> **Note: text-only ingestion.** The OpenSearch backend extracts plain text from PDFs, DOCX, and PPTX
> via `pypdf`/`docx2txt`/`python-pptx`. It does **not** currently honor `AIQ_EXTRACT_TABLES`,
> `AIQ_EXTRACT_IMAGES`, or `AIQ_EXTRACT_CHARTS` (those flags are LlamaIndex-only). For multimodal
> ingestion against OpenSearch, run the LlamaIndex backend instead, or use Foundational RAG which
> handles multimodal extraction server-side.

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: opensearch
    collection_name: my_docs
    opensearch_url: https://abc123.us-west-2.aoss.amazonaws.com
    opensearch_auth_type: sigv4
    opensearch_aws_region: us-west-2
    opensearch_aws_service: aoss
    opensearch_index_prefix: aiq
    opensearch_ingestion_mode: auto
    opensearch_dask_file_transfer: bytes
```

> **Deploying on EKS?** See the
> [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless deployment guide](../../docs/source/deployment/aws-opensearch-serverless.md)
> for the end-to-end EKS Pod Identity setup, AOSS data access policy, Helm values, and
> verification commands.

OpenSearch creates one physical index per collection using `<opensearch_index_prefix>-<collection_name>`, sanitized
for OpenSearch index naming rules. The adapter stores collection metadata in mapping `_meta` and stores each text chunk
as one OpenSearch document with a `knn_vector` field.

#### Migrating an embedding model

Persisted vectors are valid only for the exact embedding model that created them. AI-Q records that model identity in
new Chroma collections and OpenSearch indexes and rejects ingestion or retrieval when the configured model differs.
OpenSearch also validates the configured vector dimension. Collections created by older AI-Q versions do not have the
required identity marker and are rejected rather than silently mixing embedding spaces.

Before changing `AIQ_EMBED_MODEL` or the corresponding YAML setting:

1. Delete each affected logical collection through the Knowledge API or UI. For Chroma development data, selecting a
   new `AIQ_CHROMA_DIR` is also sufficient to create an isolated store.
2. Configure the new embedding model and, for OpenSearch, its matching `opensearch_embedding_dim`.
3. Recreate the collection and re-upload its source documents so every stored vector uses the new model.

Azure AI Search already derives its physical index name from the embedding model and dimension and validates the same
identity marker, so a changed model resolves to an isolated index. Its documents must still be uploaded to that new
index before retrieval can return results.

For session-isolated web uploads, AI-Q uses the conversation/session collection name, such as `s_<uuid>`. The OpenSearch
adapter maps that session collection to a dynamic index in the same OpenSearch endpoint, for example
`aiq-s_<uuid>`. The TTL cleanup task removes expired OpenSearch indexes based on their collection `_meta.updated_at`
timestamp.

OpenSearch ingestion runs locally by default. Set `opensearch_ingestion_mode: auto` or `OPENSEARCH_INGESTION_MODE=auto`
to use Dask when `NAT_DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS` is configured, falling back to local ingestion when it is not. Set
`opensearch_ingestion_mode: dask` to require Dask. In Dask mode, each worker constructs its own OpenSearch client, so
AWS SigV4 credentials are resolved in the worker environment. This supports EKS Pod Identity, SSO-backed local workers,
and standard AWS SDK environment/profile credentials. Basic-auth credentials are never sent through the Dask scheduler
as task arguments; with `opensearch_auth_type: basic`, each worker must resolve `OPENSEARCH_USERNAME` and
`OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` from its own environment, and distributed ingestion fails fast if they are not set.
`opensearch_dask_file_transfer: bytes` sends uploaded file
contents to workers and works without a shared volume; `paths` requires API and worker pods to share the same file path.

#### Live OpenSearch Integration Tests

Live tests are opt-in because they create and delete real OpenSearch indexes. They patch embeddings with deterministic
local vectors, so the tests validate OpenSearch indexing/search behavior without requiring `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.

For an unauthenticated local OpenSearch cluster:

```bash
AIQ_OPENSEARCH_LIVE_TESTS=1 \
OPENSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200 \
OPENSEARCH_AUTH_TYPE=none \
uv run python -m pytest tests/knowledge_layer_tests/test_opensearch_live.py
```

For a self-hosted cluster with basic auth:

```bash
AIQ_OPENSEARCH_LIVE_TESTS=1 \
OPENSEARCH_URL=https://opensearch.example.com:9200 \
OPENSEARCH_AUTH_TYPE=basic \
OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=admin \
OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=admin \
uv run python -m pytest tests/knowledge_layer_tests/test_opensearch_live.py
```

For Amazon OpenSearch Serverless:

```bash
AIQ_OPENSEARCH_LIVE_TESTS=1 \
OPENSEARCH_URL=https://abc123.us-west-2.aoss.amazonaws.com \
OPENSEARCH_AUTH_TYPE=sigv4 \
OPENSEARCH_AWS_SERVICE=aoss \
AWS_REGION=us-west-2 \
uv run python -m pytest tests/knowledge_layer_tests/test_opensearch_live.py
```

For Amazon OpenSearch Service domains, use `OPENSEARCH_AWS_SERVICE=es`. If you use a development cluster with
self-signed certificates, set `OPENSEARCH_VERIFY_CERTS=false`.

A dedicated Amazon OpenSearch Serverless suite is also available. It always uses SigV4 service `aoss` and expects an
AOSS data endpoint:

```bash
AIQ_OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS_LIVE_TESTS=1 \
OPENSEARCH_URL=https://abc123.us-west-2.aoss.amazonaws.com \
AWS_REGION=us-west-2 \
uv run python -m pytest tests/knowledge_layer_tests/test_opensearch_serverless_live.py
```

If you set the variables on separate lines, export them first:

```bash
export AIQ_OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS_LIVE_TESTS=1
export OPENSEARCH_URL=https://abc123.us-west-2.aoss.amazonaws.com
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
uv run python -m pytest tests/knowledge_layer_tests/test_opensearch_serverless_live.py
```

This suite validates SigV4 health checks, collection lifecycle, vector ingestion, k-NN retrieval, filtered k-NN
retrieval, and file deletion against OpenSearch Serverless. The AWS principal must have data access permissions for
index creation/deletion and document read/write operations on the target collection.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
# Import the adapter module to trigger registration
from knowledge_layer.llamaindex import LlamaIndexRetriever, LlamaIndexIngestor

# Use the factory to get instances
from aiq_agent.knowledge import get_retriever, get_ingestor

# Ingest documents
ingestor = get_ingestor("llamaindex", config={"persist_dir": "/tmp/chroma"})
ingestor.create_collection("my_docs")
job_id = ingestor.upload_file("doc.pdf", "my_docs")

# Check ingestion status
status = ingestor.get_file_status(job_id, "my_docs")
print(f"Status: {status.status}")  # UPLOADING, INGESTING, SUCCESS, FAILED

# Retrieve
retriever = get_retriever("llamaindex", config={"persist_dir": "/tmp/chroma"})
result = await retriever.retrieve("query", "my_docs", top_k=5)
for chunk in result.chunks:
    print(f"{chunk.display_citation}: {chunk.content[:100]}")
```

---

## Web UI Mode

Run the backend API server and frontend UI together for document upload, collection management, and chat.

### Start Backend

```bash
# Foundational RAG example (requires deployed FRAG server)
# Set env vars: RAG_SERVER_URL, RAG_INGEST_URL, NVIDIA_API_KEY
nat serve --config_file configs/config_web_frag.yml --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontends/ui
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/v1/collections` | Create collection |
| `GET` | `/v1/collections` | List collections |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/collections/{name}` | Delete collection |
| `POST` | `/v1/collections/{name}/documents` | Upload files |
| `GET` | `/v1/documents/{job_id}/status` | Poll ingestion status |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/collections/{name}/documents` | Delete files |

### Port Configuration

If the default port conflicts with other services (for example, RAG Blueprint uses ports 8000-8002), override it when starting Docker Compose:

```bash
PORT=8100 docker compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | 8000 | Backend API host port |

The backend always runs on port 8000 inside the container. This variable only changes the host port mapping.

For more details, see the [Docker Compose README](../../deploy/compose/README.md#port-configuration).

### Session Collections

All four shipped knowledge backends—LlamaIndex, Foundational RAG, Azure AI Search, and OpenSearch—support
session-based collections (`s_<uuid>`) created by the UI. Each UI conversation gets its own isolated logical
collection.

#### How collection routing works

Retrieval uses the active conversation or session collection when present and otherwise falls back to the configured
`collection_name`. UI ingestion and retrieval share the UI-created session collection, while API ingestion selects its
destination explicitly.

| Usage | Collection selection |
|-------|----------------------|
| UI ingestion | Active UI session collection |
| UI retrieval | Active UI session collection |
| API ingestion | Collection named by the ingestion operation |
| API retrieval | `conversation-id`, then configured `collection_name` fallback |

For request-scoped selection, environment-variable usage, and `/v1/chat/completions` header behavior, see
[Collection Routing](../../docs/source/customization/knowledge-layer.md#collection-routing).

### TTL Cleanup

Collections inactive for 24 hours are auto-deleted based on `last_indexed` timestamp. Background thread runs hourly.

```python
COLLECTION_TTL_HOURS = 24
TTL_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 3600
```

---

## Document Summaries

Document summaries help research agents understand what files are available before making tool calls. When enabled, the knowledge layer generates a one-sentence summary during ingestion and exposes it to agents through their system prompts.

### Enabling Summaries

Add `generate_summary: true` to your knowledge retrieval config:

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: llamaindex
    collection_name: test_collection
    top_k: 5
    generate_summary: true       # Enable AI-generated summaries
    summary_model: summary_llm   # Required: reference to LLM in llms: section
```

When `generate_summary: true`, you **must** configure `summary_model` to reference an LLM from your `llms:` section:

```yaml
llms:
  summary_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: google/gemma-4-31b-it
    base_url: "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
    api_key: ${NVIDIA_API_KEY}
    temperature: 0.3
    max_tokens: 150

functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    generate_summary: true
    summary_model: summary_llm   # Required when generate_summary: true
    summary_db: sqlite+aiosqlite:///./summaries.db  # Optional: defaults to SQLite
```

### Supported File Types

Summaries are generated for the following file types:

| Format | Extension | Extraction Method |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | First 2 pages via `pypdf` |
| Word | `.docx` | Body text via `docx2txt` |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx` | Slide text via `python-pptx` |
| Plain Text | `.txt` | Direct file read |
| Markdown | `.md` | Direct file read |

Other file types are ingested normally but do not receive summaries.

**Note:** Summaries are only generated during **local** ingestion. In distributed (Dask) OpenSearch
ingestion the summary LLM is not worker-serializable, so `generate_summary` is forced off and a
warning is logged; use `opensearch_ingestion_mode: local` if you require summaries.

> **Upload controls:** The frontend file picker and backend API default to `.pdf,.docx,.txt,.md` (matching
> LlamaIndex). Set `FILE_UPLOAD_ACCEPTED_TYPES` to match your selected backend. The API validates the extension,
> declared media type, and file content. `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_MB` limits each file and all files combined in one
> request; `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_COUNT` limits the number of files in one request.
>
> | Deployment | Where to set |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | **CLI** (`start_e2e.sh`) | `deploy/.env` |
> | **Docker Compose** | `deploy/.env` (passed to the frontend and backend containers) |
> | **Helm** | `deploy/helm/deployment-k8s/values.yaml` under both the backend and frontend apps' `env` sections |
>
> Example for Foundational RAG:
>
> ```bash
> FILE_UPLOAD_ACCEPTED_TYPES=.pdf,.docx,.pptx,.txt,.md
> FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_MB=100
> FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_COUNT=10
> ```

### How It Works

1. **Ingestion**: Backend extracts text from the document and generates a one-sentence summary using an LLM call
2. **Registry**: Summary is stored in a centralized, backend-agnostic registry (`aiq_agent.knowledge.factory`)
3. **Agent prompts**: Summaries appear in the agent's system prompt under "Uploaded Documents"
4. **Tool calling**: Agents can make informed decisions about when to call `knowledge_search`

### Agent Prompt Example

When documents have summaries, agents see:

```
## Uploaded Documents

The user has uploaded the following documents to the knowledge base:

- **quarterly_report.pdf**: Q3 financial results showing 15% revenue growth and improved operating margins.
- **product_roadmap.pptx**: 2024 product development timeline including AI features and cloud integrations.
- **meeting_notes.md**: Summary of Q4 planning meeting covering budget allocation and team priorities.

When the query relates to these documents, prioritize searching them before using external tools.
```

### Backend-Agnostic Design

The summary system works identically across all backends:

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `register_summary()` | `aiq_agent.knowledge.factory` | Store summary after ingestion |
| `unregister_summary()` | `aiq_agent.knowledge.factory` | Remove summary on file deletion |
| `get_available_documents()` | `aiq_agent.knowledge.factory` | Retrieve summaries for agents |

All four shipped adapters call these functions, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of backend choice.

### Summary Storage

Summaries are persisted in a database (SQLite by default) so they survive server restarts. You can configure the storage backend:

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    generate_summary: true
    summary_db: ${AIQ_SUMMARY_DB:-sqlite+aiosqlite:///./summaries.db}  # Default: SQLite
```

For production deployments, use PostgreSQL:

```bash
export AIQ_SUMMARY_DB="postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

The summary store uses SQLAlchemy and follows the same pattern as the jobs database (`db_url`), so you can point both to the same PostgreSQL instance if desired.

### Custom Summarization

To customize summary generation, modify the `generate_summary()` method in your adapter. See reference implementations:

- **LlamaIndex**: `sources/knowledge_layer/src/llamaindex/adapter.py` (search for `generate_summary`)
- **Foundational RAG**: `sources/knowledge_layer/src/foundational_rag/adapter.py` (search for `generate_summary`)

Key customization points:
- LLM model selection and prompt template
- Text extraction strategy (format-aware: pages for PDF, body text for DOCX, slide text for PPTX)
- Summary length and format constraints

---

## Building a Custom Backend

### Step 1: Create adapter directory

```bash
mkdir -p sources/knowledge_layer/src/my_backend
touch sources/knowledge_layer/src/my_backend/{__init__.py,adapter.py,README.md}
```

### Step 2: Implement the adapter with registration decorators

```python
# sources/knowledge_layer/src/my_backend/adapter.py
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
from aiq_agent.knowledge.base import BaseRetriever, BaseIngestor
from aiq_agent.knowledge.factory import register_retriever, register_ingestor
from aiq_agent.knowledge.schema import (
    Chunk, RetrievalResult, CollectionInfo, FileInfo,
    FileStatus, ContentType, IngestionJobStatus
)


@register_retriever("my_backend")  # <-- This name goes in YAML config
class MyRetriever(BaseRetriever):
    """My custom retriever implementation."""

    def __init__(self, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize your vector store client here
        self.endpoint = self.config.get("endpoint", "http://localhost:8000")

    @property
    def backend_name(self) -> str:
        return "my_backend"  # Should match registration name

    async def retrieve(
        self,
        query: str,
        collection_name: str,

> **Error Handling for UI Integration:**
>
> If you're using the web UI for document upload, your adapter must properly populate error messages in the standard schema. The UI displays `FileProgress.error_message` to users when ingestion fails - it doesn't parse backend-specific error formats.
>
> In your `get_job_status()` implementation:
> 1. Check your backend's response for failure states
> 2. Extract the error message from your backend's format (could be `error`, `message`, `result.error`, etc.)
> 3. Set `FileProgress.error_message` for the affected file
> 4. Set `FileProgress.status = FileStatus.FAILED`
>
> ```python
> # Example pattern in get_job_status():
> if backend_status == "failed":
>     error_msg = (
>         response.get("error")
>         or response.get("message")
>         or response.get("result", {}).get("message")
>         or "Unknown error"
>     )
>     file_progress.status = FileStatus.FAILED
>     file_progress.error_message = error_msg
> ```
>
> See [`src/foundational_rag/adapter.py`](src/foundational_rag/adapter.py) `get_job_status()` for a complete example.

### Step 3: Export in `__init__.py` (triggers registration on import)

```python
# sources/knowledge_layer/src/my_backend/__init__.py
"""
My Custom Backend for Knowledge Layer.

Import this module to register the backend with the factory.
"""
from .adapter import MyRetriever, MyIngestor

__all__ = ["MyRetriever", "MyIngestor"]
```

### Step 4: Register package in pyproject.toml

```toml
# sources/knowledge_layer/pyproject.toml

[project.optional-dependencies]
my_backend = [
    "requests>=2.28.0",  # Your backend's dependencies
]

[tool.setuptools]
packages = [
    "aiq_sources",
    "knowledge_layer.knowledge",
    "knowledge_layer.llamaindex",
    "knowledge_layer.foundational_rag",
    "knowledge_layer.my_backend",  # <-- Add your backend
]
```

### Step 5: Add to NAT function (for YAML config support)

To use your backend via YAML config (`backend: my_backend`), you must edit **`sources/knowledge_layer/src/register.py`**:

**Three changes required:**

1. **Add to `BackendType` Literal** - Enables Pydantic validation at config load time
2. **Add config fields to `KnowledgeRetrievalConfig`** - These become available in YAML
3. **Add backend case to `_setup_backend()`** - This instantiates your adapter

```python
# sources/knowledge_layer/src/register.py
from typing import Literal

# 1. Add your backend to the BackendType Literal for type-safe validation
BackendType = Literal["llamaindex", "foundational_rag", "my_backend"]  # <-- Add here


# 2. Add your config fields to KnowledgeRetrievalConfig class
class KnowledgeRetrievalConfig(FunctionBaseConfig, name="knowledge_retrieval"):
    backend: BackendType = Field(default="llamaindex", ...)  # Uses the Literal type
    collection_name: str = Field(...)
    top_k: int = Field(...)

    # ... existing backend fields (chroma_dir, rag_url, etc.) ...

    # ADD YOUR BACKEND'S CONFIG FIELDS HERE:
    my_backend_endpoint: str = Field(
        default="http://localhost:8000",
        description="Endpoint URL (my_backend only)"
    )
    my_backend_api_key: str = Field(
        default="",
        description="API key for authentication (my_backend only)"
    )


# 3. Add your backend case to _setup_backend() function
def _setup_backend(config: KnowledgeRetrievalConfig):
    backend = config.backend.lower()

    if backend == "llamaindex":
        # ... existing ...
    elif backend == "foundational_rag":
        # ... existing ...

    # ADD YOUR BACKEND CASE HERE:
    elif backend == "my_backend":
        import knowledge_layer.my_backend.adapter  # noqa: F401
        backend_config = {
            "endpoint": config.my_backend_endpoint,
            "api_key": config.my_backend_api_key,
        }

    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown backend: {backend}")

    return backend, backend_config
```

> **Why add to `BackendType`?** The Literal type provides compile-time validation. If someone configures `backend: llama_index` (typo), Pydantic will reject it immediately with a clear error message: *"Input should be 'llamaindex', 'foundational_rag', or 'my_backend'"* rather than failing deep in the code at runtime.

Now your backend can be configured via YAML:

```yaml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: my_backend
    collection_name: my_docs
    my_backend_endpoint: http://my-server:8000
    my_backend_api_key: ${MY_API_KEY}
```

### Step 6: Install and test

```bash
# Install
uv pip install -e "sources/knowledge_layer[my_backend]"

# Verify registration
python -c "
from knowledge_layer.my_backend import MyRetriever, MyIngestor
from aiq_agent.knowledge.factory import list_retrievers, list_ingestors
print('Registered retrievers:', list_retrievers())
print('Registered ingestors:', list_ingestors())
"
# Output should include 'my_backend'
```

### Step 7: Use in YAML config

```yaml
# your_config.yml
functions:
  knowledge_search:
    _type: knowledge_retrieval
    backend: my_backend                          # Your registration name
    collection_name: test_collection
    my_backend_endpoint: http://my-server:8000   # Your config field
    top_k: 5
```

## Architecture

### How Registration Works

Backends register themselves using decorators when their module is imported:

```python
# In adapter.py
from aiq_agent.knowledge.factory import register_retriever, register_ingestor

@register_retriever("my_backend")  # Registration name used in config
class MyRetriever(BaseRetriever):
    ...

@register_ingestor("my_backend")
class MyIngestor(BaseIngestor):
    ...
```

The registration name (e.g., `"my_backend"`) is what you use in:
- YAML config: `backend: my_backend`
- Factory calls: `get_retriever("my_backend")`

**Important:** The adapter module must be imported for registration to happen. This is why:
1. `__init__.py` imports the adapter classes
2. The NAT function imports from `knowledge_layer.<backend>.adapter`

### Core Library (`src/aiq_agent/knowledge/`)

```
src/aiq_agent/knowledge/
    __init__.py      # Exports: Chunk, get_retriever, get_ingestor, etc.
    base.py          # Abstract classes: BaseRetriever, BaseIngestor
    schema.py        # Data models: Chunk, RetrievalResult, FileInfo, CollectionInfo
    factory.py       # Registry + factory: register_retriever(), get_retriever()
```

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `base.py` | Defines the interface all backends must implement |
| `schema.py` | Universal data models - backends convert native formats to these |
| `factory.py` | Registration decorators + factory functions for instantiation |

### Backend Adapters (`sources/knowledge_layer/src/`)

```
sources/knowledge_layer/src/
    <backend_name>/
        __init__.py      # Imports adapter to trigger registration
        adapter.py       # @register_retriever/@register_ingestor decorated classes
        README.md        # Backend-specific documentation
        pyproject.toml   # Optional: isolated dependencies
```

### NeMo Agent Toolkit Integration (`sources/knowledge_layer/src/`)

```
sources/knowledge_layer/src/
    register.py      # @register_function exposes retrieval to agents
```

The `register.py` defines `KnowledgeRetrievalConfig` which maps YAML config to backend instantiation.

## Core Data Models

```python
from aiq_agent.knowledge.schema import (
    # Retrieval
    Chunk,           # Retrieved content piece (15+ fields)
    RetrievalResult, # Query result container
    ContentType,     # TEXT, IMAGE, TABLE, CHART

    # Ingestion
    CollectionInfo,  # Collection metadata
    FileInfo,        # File/job status
    FileStatus,      # UPLOADING, INGESTING, SUCCESS, FAILED
    IngestionJobStatus,  # Batch job tracking
)
```

### Chunk Schema (The "Golden Record")

```python
class Chunk(BaseModel):
    # Core content
    chunk_id: str              # Unique ID for citation tracking
    content: str               # Main text (or caption for visuals)
    score: float               # Similarity score 0.0-1.0

    # Citation (required)
    file_name: str             # Original filename
    page_number: Optional[int] # Page number (1-based)
    display_citation: str      # User-facing citation label

    # Content typing (required)
    content_type: ContentType  # TEXT, TABLE, CHART, IMAGE
    content_subtype: Optional[str]  # e.g., "bar_chart", "pie_chart"

    # Optional rich data
    structured_data: Optional[str]  # Raw data for tables/charts
    image_url: Optional[str]        # Presigned URL for images
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]        # Passthrough metadata
```

## Configuration

### Configuration Precedence

Configuration values are resolved in the following order (highest to lowest priority):

1. **Explicit parameter** - Values passed directly to factory functions (`get_retriever("llamaindex")`)
2. **YAML config file** - The `backend:` field and other options in your workflow config (recommended)
3. **Environment variables** - `KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVER_BACKEND`, `RAG_SERVER_URL`, etc.
4. **Hardcoded defaults** - Built-in fallback values

**Recommendation:** Use YAML config as your single source of truth for workflow configuration. Environment variables are useful for:
- Container deployments (12-factor app pattern)
- CI/CD overrides
- Secrets management (API keys)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Unknown backend: my_backend` | Adapter not imported/registered | Import the adapter module before calling factory |
| `ormsgpack` attribute error | Version conflict with langgraph | `uv pip install "ormsgpack>=1.5.0"` |
| Empty retrieval results | Collection empty | Run ingestion first, verify collection name matches |
| Job status 404 | Different process/instance | Factory uses singletons - ensure same process |
| `milvus-lite` required | Missing dependency | `uv pip install "pymilvus[milvus_lite]"` |
| OpenSearch SigV4 auth fails | Missing AWS credentials or wrong service | Configure AWS credentials and use `aoss` for Serverless or `es` for managed domains |
| OpenSearch SSO works in AWS CLI but fails in tests | Expired `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables override `AWS_PROFILE` | `unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN AWS_CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION`, then run `aws sso login --profile <profile>` |
| OpenSearch mapping dimension error | Embedding dimension does not match index mapping | Set `opensearch_embedding_dim` to the selected embedding model dimension before creating the collection |
| AOSS returns 403 | IAM role or data access policy is incomplete | Grant the pod/user IAM role `aoss:APIAccessAll` and an AOSS data access policy covering `index/<collection>/*` |
| Backend registered twice | Module imported multiple times | Normal - factory logs warning but works fine |

### Debug Registration

```python
# Check what's registered
from aiq_agent.knowledge.factory import list_retrievers, list_ingestors, get_knowledge_layer_config

print("Retrievers:", list_retrievers())
print("Ingestors:", list_ingestors())
print("Full config:", get_knowledge_layer_config())
```
