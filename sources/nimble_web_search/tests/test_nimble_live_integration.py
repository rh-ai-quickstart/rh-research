"""Live Nimble integration test — the minimal repeatable CI check.

Opt-in (mirrors ``tests/knowledge_layer_tests/test_opensearch_live.py``): set
``AIQ_NIMBLE_LIVE_TESTS=1`` and provide a real ``NIMBLE_API_KEY``. Cost per
run: exactly one API call, bounded at 120 seconds.

The test performs no retries of its own — the provider's built-in retry loop
(``max_retries=3`` with backoff) is part of the code under test, so a failure
here means three consecutive provider attempts failed, which is precisely the
reliability signal CI should surface.

Run:

    AIQ_NIMBLE_LIVE_TESTS=1 NIMBLE_API_KEY=<key> \
        uv run pytest sources/nimble_web_search/tests -m integration -v
