"""Request-scoped hook for reusing a caller's research depth decision.

A caller that has already classified a query (for example the MCP ``JobManager``,
which classifies once in ``submit()`` to persist ``depth`` and choose a polling
cadence) can set the resulting depth here for the duration of a single workflow
run. The ``intent_classifier`` node reuses it instead of re-invoking the intent
LLM, so the persisted depth and the executed route are the same decision.

The value rides a plain :class:`contextvars.ContextVar`, which propagates
uninterrupted through NAT's ``SessionManager.session()``/``.run()`` and the
compiled LangGraph (the same mechanism NAT itself relies on for
``conversation_id`` and its active-function stack). It defaults to ``None`` and
is never set by API/CLI callers, so the short-circuit is strictly opt-in.
