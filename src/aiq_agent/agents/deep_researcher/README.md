# Deep Researcher Package

This package implements the DeepAgents-backed deep-research path. The
[Deep Researcher architecture guide](../../../../docs/source/architecture/agents/deep-researcher.md)
is the canonical description of its runtime flow, state, middleware, and
configuration. Keep detailed behavior in the architecture guide so the public and package-local
documentation do not diverge.

## Runtime Contract

- The orchestrator coordinates stage order. It does not call source tools
  directly and normally delegates final synthesis to `writer-agent`.
- When enabled, `source-router-agent` writes advisory routing guidance before
  planning. Routing cannot restore a source excluded by the request boundary.
- `planner-agent` returns a structured `ResearchPlan` containing independent
  `ResearchQuery` objects. Their `preferred_tools` and `fallback_tools` fields
  are prompt guidance; every worker retains the full request-filtered tool set.
- `run_research_batch` runs independent researcher workers concurrently up to
  `max_research_concurrency`. Source-tool calls and concrete batched inputs have
  separate configured bounds.
- Each worker returns structured `ResearchNotes`. The writer reads the plan,
  notes, and captured sources, then writes the normative final answer to
  `/shared/output.md`.
- `_salvage_inline_report()` is a defensive compatibility path when writer
  delegation is missed. An orchestrator-authored report is not the normative
  synthesis path.
- Clarification happens before deep research only when request scope or output
  shape is materially ambiguous. The clarifier does not create or approve the
  internal research plan.
