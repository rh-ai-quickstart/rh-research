  Use this skill to turn researched or computed numeric data into source-grounded
  charts. It has two delivery modes and picks one from the tools available to you.
  When an `execute` tool (sandbox) is available, render a PNG chart plus its CSV with
  Python/matplotlib and embed it as a durable `artifact://` reference. When there is
  no sandbox, emit the chart as an inline fenced `chart` (or `chart-carousel`) JSON
  spec that the web UI renders deterministically, followed by a portable Markdown table.
  Triggers: "chart", "plot", "graph", "bar chart", "line chart", "visualize",
  "trend over time", "compare visually", "figure", "ranking", "top-N", "distribution".
  Outputs: either a PNG chart artifact (plus CSV and manifest) or an inline chart spec.

# Chart Generation Skill

Produce accurate, source-grounded charts from researched or computed data. This skill
has two delivery modes; choose the one that matches the tools you were given, then
follow the matching section below.

## Choose your mode

1. **Sandbox mode (an `execute` tool is available):** render a PNG with Python/matplotlib,
   save it as a durable artifact, and embed it by reference. Follow **Sandbox Mode (PNG
   artifact)** below.
2. **Inline mode (no `execute` tool / no sandbox):** emit the chart as an inline fenced
   `chart` JSON spec that the web app renders, plus a portable Markdown table. Follow
   **Inline Mode (chart spec)** below. Do NOT attempt to run code or produce a PNG.

The two modes are mutually exclusive and are selected only by tool availability: pick exactly
one and emit only that output path. When an `execute` tool (sandbox) is available you must use
Sandbox mode and must not emit an inline `chart` spec; only when no `execute` tool exists do you
use Inline mode. Never produce both a PNG artifact and an inline spec for the same figure.

Both modes share the same discipline: a chart confers authority, so it must be earned.

## Data sufficiency (earn the chart, both modes)

A polished chart of wrong or sparse numbers misleads more than it informs.

1. **Source-anchored points only:** every plotted value must trace to a specific source
   (the as-reported figure and its URL). Never plot a fabricated, guessed, or inferred
   number as if it were reported; mark genuine estimates as estimates.
2. **Suppress misleading charts:** if a series is mostly missing (a majority of periods
   undisclosed) or mixes metric definitions (e.g. "cash capex" vs "capex including finance
   leases"), do NOT produce a trend chart. Present the table (which shows the gaps) and
   state the limitation in one sentence instead.
3. **Show gaps honestly:** never interpolate or connect across missing periods. Plot only
   the periods a series actually reports, and render estimates distinctly so they do not
   read as reported values.
4. **Prefer gap-tolerant forms:** grouped bars show missing periods as absent bars; favor
   them over a connected line when series are uneven, since a line drawn across gaps
   implies a trend the data does not support.
5. **Use the ACTUAL numbers** from the evidence (top ~10 rows); never invent, pad, or round
   away data. If you show only the top rows of a larger set, say so.

# Sandbox Mode (PNG artifact)

Render with Python/matplotlib, save the chart as a durable artifact, and embed it in the
report by reference (never by pasting image data).

## Required Execution Standard

1. **Ground the data:** build the plotted rows from researched facts or `/shared/...`
   inputs. Keep source URLs/notes alongside the values.
2. **Normalize units** before plotting (currencies, magnitudes, periods).
3. **Render with code:** call `execute` to run Python/matplotlib. Do not hand-draw or
   fabricate charts.
4. **Write to the artifact directory:** save the PNG and its CSV under the exact
   `sandbox_artifact_dir` given in your instructions (a per-job path such as
   `/sandbox/<job_id>/aiq-artifacts`). Use that value verbatim - do NOT write to a bare
   `/sandbox/aiq-artifacts`; the runtime only harvests files under `sandbox_artifact_dir`.
5. **Write a manifest** to carry the chart's title, caption, and inline flag and to checkpoint
   it mid-run (see below). It is preferred, not strictly required: a chart left in
   `sandbox_artifact_dir` is still captured by the terminal directory scan without one.
6. **Reference, do not embed bytes:** in the report, link the chart with
   `![caption](artifact://<filename>.png)`. The runtime resolves this to the durable
   artifact; never paste base64 image data into the report.

## Execution Flow

1. Assemble the normalized rows (prefer explicit records embedded in the script). If the
   inputs live in `/shared/...`, `read_file` them first and embed the values; sandbox
   code cannot open `/shared/...`.
2. Use `write_file` to create the chart script under the exact `sandbox_workdir` from your
   instructions, then `execute` it with the exact `sandbox_artifact_dir` as its first argument.
   For example, when your instructions provide `/sandbox/JOB/` and
   `/sandbox/JOB/aiq-artifacts`, run
   `python3 /sandbox/JOB/make_chart.py /sandbox/JOB/aiq-artifacts`. Never execute a literal
   `<sandbox_workdir>` or `<sandbox_artifact_dir>` token.
   `sandbox_workdir` is already per-job, so scripts there cannot collide with another job's
   leftovers. Only ever execute a script you wrote this session. Each `execute` runs in a
   fresh shell, so `cd` does NOT persist between calls; put absolute paths in every command
   (or chain in one line as `cd <dir> && <cmd>`). The script must:
   - import pandas and matplotlib (use the non-interactive `Agg` backend),
   - build the DataFrame, compute any derived metrics,
   - set a single `ARTIFACT_DIR` to your `sandbox_artifact_dir` and write the chart
     (`<name>.png`), its data (`<name>.csv`), and `manifest.json` there (see the example).
3. Inspect the `execute` output; if it fails, fix the script and re-run (max 2 retries).
4. In the report, embed the chart with `![<caption>](artifact://<name>.png)` and cite the
   original data sources in the surrounding text.

## Placement and description in the report

Each figure must appear where it is discussed, not buried in a file list:

1. **Embed once, in context:** place the `![<caption>](artifact://<name>.png)` line inside
   the section that analyzes the figure (e.g. Results, Findings, or a Visualization
   subsection) - immediately after the paragraph that introduces it.
2. **Describe it:** precede the embed with one sentence stating what the chart shows and the
   takeaway (e.g. "The chart below compares 2025 resident population across the top five
   states; California leads at roughly 3x Pennsylvania.").
3. **Reference by filename, never a raw path:** the way to show a figure is the
   `![caption](artifact://<filename>.png)` token. Do NOT instead write the sandbox path
   (e.g. `<sandbox_artifact_dir>/<name>.png`) as prose and expect it to render - a bare path
   is not an image. Never paste the plotting code or base64 image data into the report; do
   not `read_file` a generated PNG just to verify it (that injects base64 bytes into context).
4. **One embed per artifact:** list supporting files (CSVs, manifests) by name in an
   appendix if useful, but the chart itself must be embedded inline as above.

## Manifest

Write a `manifest.json` in your `sandbox_artifact_dir` so the runtime captures the chart
with its metadata. The manifest is the preferred path, not a hard requirement: a successful
`execute` checkpoints the manifest-declared artifacts immediately, and the manifest carries the
`title`, `caption`, and `inline` flag that let the chart render inline with a caption. If no
valid manifest is written, the terminal directory scan still captures any file left in
`sandbox_artifact_dir` as a successful fallback, but with default metadata (no title or caption,
and not auto-inlined), so the manifest is how you get an inline, captioned chart. Manifest
`path` values must be absolute and inside your `sandbox_artifact_dir` (the per-job path from
your instructions). Construct every manifest path from the runtime argument as shown below; do
not hand-copy an angle-bracket placeholder into JSON. Set `inline: true` only for a raster image
intended to appear in the report.

## Example Script

```python
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use("Agg")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    raise SystemExit("usage: make_chart.py ABSOLUTE_SANDBOX_ARTIFACT_DIR")
ARTIFACT_DIR = Path(sys.argv[1])
if not ARTIFACT_DIR.is_absolute():
    raise SystemExit("artifact directory must be an absolute path")
ARTIFACT_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

rows = [
    {"company": "ExampleCo", "revenue_usd_billions": 12.4, "source": "https://example.com/filing"},
    {"company": "SampleInc", "revenue_usd_billions": 9.1, "source": "https://example.com/10k"},
]
df = pd.DataFrame(rows).sort_values("revenue_usd_billions", ascending=False)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
ax.bar(df["company"], df["revenue_usd_billions"])
ax.set_ylabel("Revenue (USD billions)")
ax.set_title("2024 Revenue Comparison")
fig.tight_layout()

png_path = ARTIFACT_DIR / "revenue_chart.png"
csv_path = ARTIFACT_DIR / "revenue_chart.csv"
fig.savefig(png_path, dpi=150)
df.to_csv(csv_path, index=False)

manifest = {
    "version": 1,
    "artifacts": [
        {
            "path": str(png_path),
            "kind": "image",
            "title": "2024 Revenue Comparison",
            "caption": "Revenue normalized to USD billions.",
            "inline": True,
            "source_files": [r["source"] for r in rows],
        }
    ],
}
with (ARTIFACT_DIR / "manifest.json").open("w", encoding="utf-8") as handle:
    json.dump(manifest, handle)

print(f"wrote {png_path}")
```

Run the script with the two exact per-job paths given in your instructions. The second argument
must be the real absolute artifact directory, not an angle-bracket placeholder. Treat the
artifact-checkpoint response after `execute` as authoritative: reference the exact confirmed
filename in the report and do not invent or rename it later.

## Sandbox notes and limitations

- Use the `Agg` backend; the sandbox has no display.
- Keep charts legible: labeled axes, a title, and a legend when multiple series are shown.
- Do not call `read_file` on the generated PNG merely to verify it; binary reads return base64
  and waste model context. Inspect `manifest.json` with `read_file(file_path=...)` when needed,
  then rely on the artifact-checkpoint response to confirm the accepted filename and inline state.
- If matplotlib or pandas is unavailable, report that the sandbox image needs them rather
  than fabricating a chart.
- Reference charts only by `artifact://<filename>`; the runtime assigns the durable id and
  rewrites the reference for the UI, PDF export, and the packaged skill CLI.

# Inline Mode (chart spec)

When there is no `execute` tool, present numbers that compare multiple things (a ranking or
top-N across entities, a distribution or counts across categories, a trend over an
ordered/time axis, or gains vs losses) as an inline chart, not just prose or a table. Lead
with a one-sentence verdict, then the chart.

- Emit the chart as a fenced code block tagged `chart` holding a SINGLE line of valid JSON
  (no comments, no trailing commas), right after the sentence that introduces it.
- Chart to reveal the pattern and state the verdict in prose. Inline `chart` blocks render
  only in the web app, so ALSO place a compact markdown table of the same values immediately
  after each chart, keeping PDF, Markdown, API, and CLI exports readable.
- At most 3 charts per section, and put each chart before any table.
- A single value or a one-entity yes/no result is NOT a chart: emit a KPI-only block, a
  fenced `chart` block whose JSON has just `title` and `kpis`.

Chart types: `bar` (category magnitudes), `hbar` (rankings with long text labels),
`line`/`area` (a trend across an ordered axis), `grouped-bar` (2-4 series per category),
`delta` (gains vs losses around zero).

Spec fields: `type`; `title` (short) and optional `subtitle`; `x` = `{ "key": "<field in each
row>", "label": "optional" }`; optional `y` = `{ "label": "optional unit", "format": "number |
compact | percent | currency" }`; `series` = `[ { "key": "<numeric field>", "label": "optional",
"color": "green | blue | amber | red" } ]`; `data` = rows as objects with raw numbers (fractions
0-1 for `percent`); optional `kpis` = `[ { "label": "...", "value": "preformatted", "tone": "accent
| warn | alarm" } ]`. A `delta` chart encodes exactly one series.

Example (ranking):

```chart
{"type":"hbar","title":"Top suppliers by late shipments","x":{"key":"supplier"},"y":{"format":"number"},"series":[{"key":"late","color":"amber"}],"data":[{"supplier":"Acme","late":42},{"supplier":"Globex","late":31},{"supplier":"Initech","late":19}]}
```

Example (single value, KPI-only):

```chart
{"title":"On-time delivery rate","kpis":[{"label":"On-time","value":"92.4%","tone":"accent"}]}
```

For several related trends over time, emit one fenced `chart-carousel` block holding a SINGLE
line of JSON with at least two line-chart specs: `{ "title": "...", "charts": [ <line chart
spec>, ... ] }`.

Example (related trends, carousel):

```chart-carousel
{"title":"Quarterly delivery trends","charts":[{"type":"line","title":"On-time delivery rate","x":{"key":"quarter"},"y":{"format":"percent"},"series":[{"key":"rate","color":"green"}],"data":[{"quarter":"Q1","rate":0.88},{"quarter":"Q2","rate":0.90},{"quarter":"Q3","rate":0.93}]},{"type":"line","title":"Late shipments","x":{"key":"quarter"},"y":{"format":"number"},"series":[{"key":"late","color":"amber"}],"data":[{"quarter":"Q1","late":52},{"quarter":"Q2","late":41},{"quarter":"Q3","late":28}]}]}
```
